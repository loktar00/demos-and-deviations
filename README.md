# demos-and-deviations
Collection of all my demos in one place

https://loktar00.github.io/demos-and-deviations


## Why?

I realized I have hundreds of random bits of code scattered everywhere, random harddrives, different web sites and services, and of course github. The idea is to have a centrialized location for my random small demos. Demos include anything from small games I might be working on, generative art, or small reusable snippets.

## Primary features (in progress)

The primary idea is to just develop my demos via this repo, in order to stay even somewhat disciplined I need a web interface similar to codepen, or jsfiddle. That will be the majority of the immediate work after porting my existing demos over.

An additional side benefit, since I absolutely love the GH activity graph is that I'll get a more accurate representation when it comes to my recreation code which generally happens nights and weekends.
